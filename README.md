# Photo App

## Overview

This project is a **photo drawing/editing app** with a photo selector, 
similar to a *simple* markup photo app. It will let the user choose photos from
their computer to edit. 

The people who will use it are people who want to **draw** on a photo
or draw for the fun of it. I'm interested in a project
like this because I personally enjoy art
(although I'm not great myself...) and I believe I would
find an app like this useful for my own everyday entertainment.

## Features
Editing can involve drawing with **varying brush strokes/sizes**,
**colours**, **opacities**, **brush types** (felts, pens, pencils, etc.)

Users can create custom brushes and save them
to a "pencil-case."

Users may also export their photos.
