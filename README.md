# Photo App

This project is a **photo drawing/editing app** with a photo selector, 
similar to a *simple* markup photo app. It will let the user choose photos from
their computer to edit. Editing can involve drawing with **varying brush strokes/sizes**,
**colours**, **opacities**, **brush types** (felts, pens, pencils, etc.) 
or even **cropping**.


The people who will use it are people who want to **quickly edit** a photo 
or draw for the fun of it. I'm interested in a project 
like this because I personally enjoy art
(although I'm not great myself...) and I believe I would
find an app like this useful for my own everyday tasks.
